Here are the correct answers and explanations for each question:

1. Answer: B: ReferenceError: greetign is not defined
   Explanation: There is a typo in the code. Instead of declaring the variable as "greeting," it's declared as "greetign." Due to this typo, JavaScript will throw a ReferenceError because "greetign" is not defined.

2. Answer: D: 3
   Explanation: JavaScript will attempt to perform type coercion and convert the string "2" to a number when adding it to 1. The result is 3, so the function returns 3.

3. Answer: A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
   Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the `food` array to `info.favoriteFood`. Later, it changes the value of `info.favoriteFood` to "🍝," but it doesn't modify the original `food` array. So, when you log `food`, it remains unchanged, and the output is `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`.

4. Answer: B: Hi there, undefined
   Explanation: The `sayHi` function expects an argument `name`, but it is called without an argument. In this case, `name` is undefined, so the function returns "Hi there, undefined."

5. Answer: B: 2
   Explanation: The `forEach` loop iterates through the `nums` array and increments the `count` variable by 1 for each non-falsy element (non-zero). Since there are two non-zero elements (1 and 2) in the array, `count` becomes 2, and that's what gets logged to the console.
